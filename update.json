Quickly switch between Performance and Normal modes using volume key combinations (suited for gaming or daily use). When charging, the module automatically applies preset temperature controls to balance performance and heat. Adjust temperature limits and feature toggles via config files, and it fixes system restrictions like optimizing forced-selection popups.
